### TIY-Assignments

This repository is meant to be a placeholder for homework assignments as completed by [philly.cc] (https://github.com/phillycc), a student enrolled in the Iron Yard Academy's Front End Engineering class. This 12-week intensive course is being held in Orlando in Fall 2014. The lead instructor is [David Rogers](https://github.com/al_the_x).

==================

For the GitHub uninitiated, a ReadME file is a great place to describe your repository or project in more detail. A well-written ReadME broadly describes the contents of the project and allows the reader to quickly decide whether to watch, if not collaborate, on the project.
